# JavaFXTut

A JavaFX app starts by extending on a base class called Application.
The start method overrides and allows for creation of the window.
The window uses a grid layout to get elements on it.
The scene can contain elements such as labels, textfields, and buttons.
Listeners are put on actions such as a button press to allow for a user to interface with the app.
CSS can be used to stylize the UI elements.
